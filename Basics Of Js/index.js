// TODO: What are DataTypes?
// The Type of data that we are dealing with is reffered as data types
// Premitive DataType / Non primetive Data Type
// toDO: what are Premetive Datatypes?
// Datatypes that are Predefined.
// TODO: what are non Premitive Datatypes?
// They are the customised datatype

// TODO: In JS what are the Premitive DT available to us?
// number
// string
// boolean
// undefined
// null
// symbol

// TODO: in JS what are the no Premitive DTs available to us?
// function
// object
// arrays

// TODO: Datatypes

// number
//   ---> Infinity
//  ---> -Infinity
// ---> NaN (not a number)
//  NaN == NaN  ---> Always be false
// "Ayush" -> NaN
// "Katiyar" -> NaN
// isNaN(variable) --> would return true if it is NaN and false if Not.

// TODO: What is variable Declariation?
// "Programers dont declare War the declare variables."
// we can declare variables in js via "let", "const" and "var" keyword.

var a;
let b;
const c;
// TODO : Why is there the need of 3 keywords for declaring a variable?
  // Scoping
  // TODO: what is scoping
  // The area of visibility of the variable is reffered as scoping.
  // TODO: is there any type of scoping available?
  // there are 2 types of scoping
  // 1. functional Scope ->
    // Means even if the variable is defined at the last lin of the function then also it
    //  would be accessible to the first line of the function without giving any errors.
  // 2. Blocked Scope ->
    // TODO: What Block is?
      // if the peice of code is written within certain curly braces then it is a block of code.
      // For Eg.
        // {
        //  ...
        //  }
        // in this eg the block of code is within the curly braces is ...
    // Means if the variable is declared in  a block then it is accessible within that block and only after its declaration.
  // if any variable is defined with var the it is a functional scoped variable
  // if any variable is defined with let or const then it is blocked scope variable
// the difference b/w const and let is that let variable can be redefiend but with const that is not the case.
